## What is Flash Card Quiz?
Flash Card Quizz is designed to help you learn 500 most common used Italian words by playing a quiz. A card with a random Italian word will show up in the screen. The player has 3 seconds to answer in English. After 3 seconds the card will flip by showing the English translation of the Italian word. After checking your answer with the English translation shown on the card, the user can click "x" button on the left if the answer was incorrect, or "✔" on the right if the answer was correct. Next, a new card will show up with a new Italian word. In the end a new csv file named "words_to_learn.csv" will be generated containing all the words that the player was not able to guess.
